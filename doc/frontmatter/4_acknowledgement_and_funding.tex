First of all, I would like to express my thanks and gratitude to my Master's thesis tutors, Dr. Daniel Urda Mu√±oz and Dr. Santiago Marco, who have always been there to solve all my doubts, discuss, and propose different approaches to develop the project. 

Besides, I would like to express my gratitude to all the professors who have provided us with new knowledge in this Master, who despite being online, have been very close helping us with everything we have needed. 
I would also like to extend my thanks to the GICAP research group at the University of Burgos for giving me the opportunity to participate in this innovative project, reaffirming my interest in this field, and for allowing me to concentrate on the Master to finish it as soon as possible.

Last but not least, I would like to express my gratitude to my family and friends, who have been a constant source of inspiration and a great support to me. In particular, I would like to highlight my couple, whose unconditional support and trust in me have been essential.
