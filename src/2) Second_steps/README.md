* **3_Notebook-3_Extract_Features.ipynb**: This notebook is used to extract features from a public dataset extracted from a repository available on [GitHub](https://github.com/giulbia/baby_cry_detection.git).
* **4_Notebook-4_MLP_Multi-class.ipynb**: This notebook shows two implementations of the Multilayer Perceptron (**MLP**) model. The first implementation tests without cross-validation, while the second implementation tests using cross-validation.
* **5_Notebook-5_SVM_Multi-class.ipynb**: This notebook shows two implementations of the Support Vector Machine (**SVM**) model. The first implementation tests without cross-validation, while the second implementation tests using cross-validation.
* **6_Notebook-6_LSTM_Multi-class.ipynb**: This notebook shows two implementations of the Long Short-Term Memory (**LSTM**) model. The first implementation tests without cross-validation, while the second implementation tests using cross-validation.
